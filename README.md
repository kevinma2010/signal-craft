# SignalCraft

> Craft better decisions from better signals.

SignalCraft is an open-source AI intelligence agent for tracking builders, primary sources, official updates, repositories, podcasts, and frontier topics.

It collects high-signal information from multiple sources, reduces repetition, preserves evidence, and turns the result into concise daily or weekly briefings.

## Why SignalCraft

Important AI developments are scattered across:

- Builder and researcher posts
- Official blogs and changelogs
- GitHub releases and maintainer discussions
- YouTube videos and podcasts
- Product documentation
- Research publications
- Emerging topic conversations

SignalCraft helps users answer three questions:

1. What changed?
2. Why does it matter?
3. What should I examine or try next?

## Project Principles

- Stay close to primary sources.
- Follow people doing the work.
- Prefer original insight over repeated commentary.
- Merge duplicated stories.
- Preserve links and supporting evidence.
- Optimize for usefulness.
- Respect the user's attention.

See [docs/DESIGN.md](docs/DESIGN.md).

## Current Status

SignalCraft is in the early open-source MVP stage.

The initial scope includes:

- Curated AI builder updates
- Official product and company updates
- GitHub releases
- YouTube and podcast summaries
- Grok-driven X and topic discovery
- Daily and weekly digests
- Original source links
- Local preferences

See [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md).

## Planned Workflow
