# SignalCraft

> Craft better decisions from better signals.

SignalCraft is an open-source AI intelligence agent for tracking builders, primary sources, official updates, repositories, podcasts, and frontier topics.

It collects high-signal information from multiple sources, reduces repetition, preserves evidence, and turns the result into concise daily or weekly briefings.

## Why SignalCraft

Important AI developments are scattered across:

- Builder and researcher posts
- Official blogs and changelogs
- GitHub releases and maintainer discussions
- YouTube videos and podcasts
- Product documentation
- Research publications
- Emerging topic conversations

SignalCraft helps users answer three questions:

1. What changed?
2. Why does it matter?
3. What should I examine or try next?

## Project Principles

- Stay close to primary sources.
- Follow people doing the work.
- Prefer original insight over repeated commentary.
- Merge duplicated stories.
- Preserve links and supporting evidence.
- Optimize for usefulness.
- Respect the user's attention.

See [docs/DESIGN.md](docs/DESIGN.md).

## Current Status

SignalCraft is in the early open-source MVP stage.

The initial scope includes:

- Curated AI builder updates
- Official product and company updates
- GitHub releases
- YouTube and podcast summaries
- Grok-driven X and topic discovery
- Daily and weekly digests
- Original source links
- Local preferences

See [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md).

## Installation

SignalCraft is a single agent skill backed by Bun connector scripts. User data
is stored outside the checkout in `~/.signalcraft/`.

### Clone as a Claude Code skill

Clone the repository into the personal skills directory for automatic loading:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kevinma2010/signal-craft.git ~/.claude/skills/signalcraft
cd ~/.claude/skills/signalcraft
bun install
```

Restart Claude Code after installation. The checkout appears as a
skills-directory plugin and does not require a marketplace.

### Load as a Claude Code plugin

For a local checkout, install dependencies and load the plugin directly:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kevinma2010/signal-craft.git
cd signal-craft
bun install
claude --plugin-dir "$PWD"
```

The local plugin manifest lives at `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`. Run
`/reload-plugins` after changing the skill or manifest. Marketplace installs use
`claude plugin install signal-craft@<marketplace>` after a marketplace publishes
this repository; `claude --plugin-dir` is the supported installation path for
the current standalone repository.

## Runtime Setup

Required:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash
bun install
```

Install `yt-dlp` for YouTube metadata, native subtitles, and audio fallback:

```bash
brew install yt-dlp
```

Install and authenticate Grok Build for the default X collection path:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://x.ai/cli/install.sh | bash
grok login
```

Optional credentials are read from environment variables only:

```bash
export GITHUB_TOKEN="..."
export DEEPGRAM_API_KEY="..."
export DEEPSEEK_API_KEY="..."
export X_BEARER_TOKEN="..."
```

- `GITHUB_TOKEN` raises GitHub API rate limits.
- `DEEPGRAM_API_KEY` enables ASR only when native subtitles or transcripts are
  unavailable.
- `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY` enables full-text translation.
- `X_BEARER_TOKEN` is ignored unless the paid X API adapter is also explicitly
  enabled in configuration.

Missing optional credentials or binaries degrade only the affected connector.

## Configuration

SignalCraft creates `~/.signalcraft/config.yaml` and
`~/.signalcraft/sources.yaml` during first-run setup. The source file is an
overlay on `sources.default.yaml`; use source IDs from that default pack when
selecting paid X API sources.

The X API is disabled by default. Enabling it requires explicit source IDs and
fail-closed hard budgets:

```yaml
version: 1
x_api:
  enabled: true
  source_ids:
    - openai-developers-x
    - claude-developers-x
  max_post_reads_per_run: 100
  max_post_reads_per_day: 200
  max_post_reads_per_month: 4000
  max_cost_usd_per_run: 0.50
  max_cost_usd_per_day: 1.00
  max_cost_usd_per_month: 20.00
  max_pages_per_query: 1
  cost_per_post_read_usd: 0.005
  fail_closed: true
```

Keep `source_ids` narrow. SignalCraft checks remote usage before paid requests,
does not paginate beyond the configured limit, and stops when any local budget
would be exceeded. Configure a low spending limit and disable automatic recharge
in the X Developer Console as an independent billing guard. Daily and weekly
reports reuse archived items; report generation does not fetch the same interval
again.

Connector smoke commands use the same contract:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.signalcraft/inbox
bun scripts/fetch-rss.ts \
  --config ~/.signalcraft/sources.yaml \
  --since 2026-07-15T00:00:00Z \
  --out ~/.signalcraft/inbox/rss.jsonl
```

Replace `fetch-rss.ts` and the output filename with `fetch-github.ts`,
`fetch-youtube.ts`, or `fetch-x.ts` for the other connectors.

## Testing

Install dependencies, then run the quality gates from the repository root:

```bash
bun run lint
bun run typecheck
bun run test:unit
bun run test:e2e
bun test
```

Tests use mocks and do not require real API credentials, a Grok login, or
`yt-dlp`. Real provider checks are manual smoke tests and may consume paid API
quota.
